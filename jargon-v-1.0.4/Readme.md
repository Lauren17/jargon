## Single Post Template
To display a single post you have to create a template that will display the post content. The default template used for displaying a post is single.php. You can read more about this template and yes you guessed it at the [Theme Developers Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/post-template-files/#single-php)

1. Create a file in the root of your theme folder called single.php.
1. Copy and paste the code below into your single.php template.
1. Upload this new template file
1. Return to the post editor and click on your post view option.
1. You now should see the title along with the text you added but note whats happening to the header.
